# pocket
Inspired by Symfony's "service container". The aim is to be able to get tools/services faster by instantiating the objects and automatically inject the dependencies, like a magician pulling an object out of his pocket.

Pocket is currently being developed in `PHP 8`, and will take advantage of it's new features as much as possible (e.g. defining meta data using `Attributes`)
